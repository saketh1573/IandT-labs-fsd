## Web Development Course Projects Repository

Welcome to the IandT-labs-fsd repository! This repository contains the projects I have created during my web development course. Below is a brief description of each project:

### 1. Best Friends Page

In this project, I have created a "Best Friends" page using HTML. The page showcases a collection of my best friends, along with some information about each of them. It's a simple HTML page designed to practice structuring content using semantic HTML elements.

### 2. E-commerce Website

For this project, I have developed a dynamic e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The website offers a user-friendly shopping experience with various product categories, product listings, and a shopping cart functionality. I utilized CSS to style the website, making it visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

### 3. Portfolio Page

In this project, I have designed a personal portfolio page using HTML and CSS. The portfolio page highlights my skills, work experiences, and showcases some of my web development projects. The page is designed with a clean and professional layout to impress potential employers or clients.

### 4. To-Do List

For this project, I have created a functional To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The To-Do List allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and it also features task prioritization. The use of JavaScript enables a seamless user experience by updating the list dynamically without the need for page refreshes.

### 5. SQL Basics File

In this project, I have included an SQL file that covers the basic understanding of MySQL. The SQL file contains sample queries and explanations on database creation, table creation, data insertion, and simple data manipulation. It's intended to provide a foundational knowledge of working with databases and SQL queries.

I hope you find these projects interesting and insightful! Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details on each of them. Happy coding!
